                    <h2>The Story</h2>
                    <p>The Catalyst Initiative started out of pure drive from a young woman who loved both design and code. Although her current field of study is design, one of her favorite past times is coding. She sometimes envies her friends in STEM fields, whose intelligence seems light years ahead of hers. However, she has reconciled this by trading her design skills for their intelligence.</p>
                    <p>Through talks with her friends and personal experiences in the classroom, she felt that many STEM classes and buildings were missing the touch of well-designed material that wasn't various shades of blue and black.</p>
                    <p>Over a semester, she began researching the best way a designer could impact and influence other young women to consider STEM topics. The result? This website!</p>
                    <p>Since she is just one person, much of the knowledge and information has been sourced from all over the web, with much of it being linked to its content. Furthermore, all images besides the logo were sourced from Unsplash. In the meantime, she hopes you enjoy the website and learn something new!</p>
